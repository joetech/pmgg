## PREAMBLE

The "Greater Lunduke License" is inspired, in part, by the wisdom of the Two Great Ones, Bill S. Preston, Esq. and Ted "Theodore" Logan.  Namely that we should all "be excellent to each other", that being "bogus" is "most non-triumphant" and that all dudes should "party on".

This license applies those concepts in such a way that it is applicable to all forms of content, including, but not limited to: software, books, music, movies and various works of art.
